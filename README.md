# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

With OOP developers manipulate objects and this approach is well suited for large, complex and constantly updated or maintained programs. Through inheritance, we can minimize codes. It also makes the developing process very benefical to collaborative development since projects are dividing into groups that improve sustainability and efficiency.

## Benefits of OOP
- Re-usability
- Security
- Extensibility
- Maintainability
- Efficiency
- Understandability
- Developing complex software

# Abstraction 
Abstraction is  setting rules for behaviours of classes and stricting their action and hiding any unncessary implementations. Derived classes can extend their abilities which helps us to organize our flow so we can easily make additional changes or implement new functions.

# Class

Classes are our blueprints of everything like attributes, methods or objects. Each of them can have different abilities or functions as our intend. They always have the same as the class.

# Constructor

Constructors are preparing the new object for us to use them as we need them. They can be used to set the values of the mmeber of an object.

# Inheritance
 One of key feature of OOP is inheritance. We can create new classes from base class which inherits all the properties and behaviors of its parent but also can extend itself. This greatly increase the code reusability and efficiency. 

# Interface

Interfaces are used for abstraction.

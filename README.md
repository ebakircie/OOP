# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

With OOP developers manipulate objects and this approach is well suited for large, complex and constantly updated or maintained programs. Through inheritance, we can minimize codes. It also makes the developing process very benefical to collaborative development since projects are dividing into groups that improve sustainability and efficiency.

## Benefits of OOP
- Re-usability
- Security
- Extensibility
- Maintainability
- Efficiency
- Understandability
- Developing complex software
